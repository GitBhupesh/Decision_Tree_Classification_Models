# Decision_Tree_Classification_Models
Decision Tree is a Supervised learning technique that can be used for both classification and Regression problems, but mostly it is preferred for solving Classification problems.

## Mushroom Type Prediction

## Introduction

Mushroom hunting (otherwise known as "shrooming") is enjoying new peaks in popularity. In this case study we will learn which features spell certain death and which are most palatable in this dataset of mushroom characteristics. Problem Statement: Use decision tree algorithm to predict whether a mushroom sample is poisonous or edible Dataset Information: This dataset includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family Mushroom.Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. This latter class was combined with the poisonous one. The Guide clearly states that there is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom; no rule like "leaflets three, let it be’’ for Poisonous Oak and Ivy.

## Problem Statement

Use decision tree algorithm to predict whether a mushroom sample is poisonous or edible.


## Mobile Price Prediction

## Introduction

Bob has started his own mobile company. He wants to give a tough fight to big companies like Apple, Samsung etc. He does not know how to estimate the price of mobiles his company creates. In this competitive mobile phone market, you cannot simply assume things. To solve this problem he collects sales data of mobile phones of various companies. Bob wants to find out some relation between features of a mobile phone(eg:- RAM, Internal Memory etc) and its selling price. But he is not so good at Machine Learning. So he needs your help to solve this problem.

## Problem Statement

In this problem, you do not have to predict the actual price but a price range indicating how high the price is using Random Forest & Decision Tree.
